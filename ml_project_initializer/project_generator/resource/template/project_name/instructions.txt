Project Setup Instructions
===========================

This document provides instructions for setting up the project environment on Windows and Linux operating systems using provided setup scripts.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed

Setup Instructions:
--------------------

Windows:
--------
1. Open a Command Prompt in the project directory.
2. Run the setup script by typing:
   setup.bat
   and press Enter.
This script will create a virtual environment, activate it, and install all required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

Linux:
------
1. Open a Terminal in the project directory.
2. First, make the setup script executable by typing:
   chmod +x setup.sh
   and press Enter.
3. Run the setup script by typing:
   ./setup.sh
   and press Enter.
Similar to Windows, this script will create a virtual environment, activate it, and install all required dependencies.

Activating the Virtual Environment Manually:
--------------------------------------------
If you need to activate the virtual environment manually after it's been created:

Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate

Deactivating the Virtual Environment:
-------------------------------------
To deactivate the virtual environment, simply type:
deactivate
and press Enter, in both Windows and Linux terminals.

Running the Project:
--------------------
- Add specific instructions for running your project here, such as how to start a development server or execute a particular script.

Additional Notes:
-----------------
- Ensure Python and pip are correctly installed and accessible from your command line or terminal.
- The setup scripts are intended to simplify the initial setup process. If you encounter issues, verify your Python installation and the contents of the setup scripts.
